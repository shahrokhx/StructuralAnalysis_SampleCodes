#### Details:
This repository is part of a set of engineering-related codes, where you can find more details in <a href="https://www.sshahi.com/projects/cse-fem-demo/" target="_blank">this blog post</a>, and the <a href="https://www.sshahi.com/teaching/" target="_blank">teaching</a> section of my personal website.


More specifically, this package includes the following items:
1.	A single-file script for analyzing beams and planar frames.
2.	A single-file script for analyzing truss structures.
3.	A small program for modeling and analyzing the famous __conical bar under self-weight__ problem, where a simple GUI has also been created to facilitate the modeling and studying results.
In all cases, the instructions for generating input files and some sample input files are provided.
